A full featured app to allow Steam users to explore their libraries in unique ways.

Logging into Steam will allow a user to explore their personal library to
1. look for sales on DLC
2. explore common tags within their library
3. find games that are buried within a backlog
4. pick a random game to play from their library

Without logging in, the user will still have the ability to explore the current Top 10 games on Steam, but will not be able to launch them.
